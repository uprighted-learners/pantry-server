// There was a ton of confusion around the difference between server and client/html endpoints in my last project, so I looked it up. I couldn't find it using strategic key words, so I asked ChatGPT, but wanted to be sure so I finally just added the exact code -app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes); vs. app.use("/", authRoutes);- to the search engine and that worked. I read this article -https://dev.to/aritik/setting-up-auth-routes-with-express-57oi- This allows for the server/client separation. (Nick asked why, and this is why)
